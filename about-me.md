# About Chaira Harder

Hello! I'm Chaira (ich heiße Chaira/ฉันชื่อชายร่า) and I'm a software developer based in the greater New York City area. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Smith College and focus my work on building products that are grounded in community impact.

Having grown up internationally, I'm committed to developing technology and businesses that uplift communities while bridging cultural divides through greater connectivity. I love working on multidisciplinary teams where I can blend software engineering, venture building, and product strategy.

Outside of my professional projects, I'm an enthusiastic athlete who never turns down an adventure. I recharge through sports, live music, discovering new food spots, and traveling to learn from different cultures.
